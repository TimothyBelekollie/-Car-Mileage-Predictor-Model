## Introduction
The Car Mileage Predictor Model is a machine learning project that predicts the mileage (fuel efficiency) of cars based on various features such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. The project utilizes a Linear Regression model implemented with Python's scikit-learn library.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Auto MPG" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes the following features:
- `mpg`: Miles per gallon (target variable)
- `cylinders`: Number of cylinders
- `displacement`: Engine displacement
- `horsepower`: Engine horsepower
- `weight`: Weight of the car
- `acceleration`: Acceleration
- `model year`: Model year of the car
- `origin`: Origin of the car (categorical feature)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TimothyBelekollie/Car-Mileage-Predictor-Model
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install JupyterLab if not already installed:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

## Usage
To use the Car Mileage Predictor Model, follow these steps:

1. Launch JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the `car_mileage_predictor.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Model Training
The model training process includes:
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical features, and standardizing numerical features).
2. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. Training a Linear Regression model on the training data.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## Results
The model's performance on the testing set is as follows:
- Mean Absolute Error: `2.3542812072204007`

- R-squared: `1.5343667121064641`
